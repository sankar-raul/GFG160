## 🏅 Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
```
**Output:**

```plaintext
[5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
```
> **Explanation:** The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second-last position, and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.

### Example 2:
**Input:**

```plaintext
arr = [4, 5, 2]
```
**Output:**

```plaintext
[2, 5, 4]
```
> **Explanation:** The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be 2 5 4.

### Example 3:
**Input:**

```plaintext
arr = [1]
```
**Output:**

```plaintext
[1]
```
> **Explanation:** The array has only a single element, so the reversed array is the same as the original.

## 📏 Constraints:
```
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
```
```
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
```
